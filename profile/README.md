# 🐻 SlyCubGames

**Welcome to the den.**

SlyCubGames is the rogue bear cub of TTRPG tools – creating modular resources for game masters and storytellers who like a bit of chaos with their campaigns.

### 🛠️ **What We’re Building:**
- **Questitch:** The main project, a fast-prep GM toolkit that stitches together all our modules into one cohesive system.
- **Modular Components:**  
  - 🗺️ **Encounter Maps:** Procedurally generated maps for unpredictable encounters.  
  - 🧙‍♂️ **Character & Item Generators:** Create NPCs with quirks, flaws, and questionable life choices.  
  - 📜 **Story Weavers:** Modular campaign arc builder – because every hero needs a tragic backstory.  
  - 💀 **Loot & Lore:** Random tables, name generators, and artifacts of questionable utility.  
  - 🐾 **Encounter Builder:** Quickly spin up encounters that won’t get your party TPK’d. (Probably.)

### 🦝 **Why Rogue Bears?**
- Because bears are sneaky. Cubs are cute. And we’re both.
